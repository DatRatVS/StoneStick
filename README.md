_I wondered, why isn't there different types of stick in Minecraft? So, i decided to make **a simple mod that adds a craftable and useable Stone Stick into Minecraft.**_
_Not being vanilla-friendly at all and using the Forge Tag, Stone Stick actually adds itself in every recipe that could have used a normal stick!_
